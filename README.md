## Inspiration

The Enigma machine is a symbol of both technological genius and the high stakes of wartime secrecy. Its story is not just about cryptography, but about the people—mathematicians, engineers, and codebreakers—who changed the course of history. I wanted to make this story interactive and accessible, so everyone can experience the drama and brilliance behind the code.

## What it does

Hackstory: Enigma Edition is a modern web app that lets users:
- Explore an interactive timeline of Enigma's history
- Simulate the Enigma machine and see how encryption worked
- Learn about cryptography, Alan Turing, and the codebreakers of Bletchley Park
- Discover the impact of codebreaking on world history

## How I built it

- **Frontend:** React/Next.js with Framer Motion for smooth animations and Tailwind CSS for a modern, accessible design.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) for the Enigma logic and API endpoints.
- **Features:** Interactive Enigma simulator, animated timeline, educational content, and responsive design for all devices.

## Challenges I ran into

- Accurately modeling the Enigma's complex rotor and plugboard logic
- Creating an intuitive, visually appealing UI for technical concepts
- Ensuring historical accuracy and finding reliable sources
- Synchronizing frontend animations with backend logic

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

- Built a fully functional Enigma simulator with real-time encryption
- Designed an engaging timeline that makes history interactive
- Made cryptography approachable for all ages and backgrounds
- Created a platform that can be expanded with more stories and features

## What I learned

- Deep insights into the mechanics and history of the Enigma machine
- How to translate complex technical and historical topics into interactive web experiences
- The importance of clear design and accessibility in educational tools

## What's next for Hackstory

- Deepen my research: Add more untold stories, primary sources, and expert interviews
- Expand the timeline with more events and multimedia
- Add codebreaking challenges and interactive tutorials
- Translate content into more languages
- Collaborate with educators and historians to ensure accuracy and impact
