        "info": "The first Enigma machine was developed in 1918 by Arthur Scherbius, a German engineer. Initially, it was marketed as a commercial encryption device for businesses to protect their communications. Scherbius presented the machine at trade shows and tried to sell it to banks, companies, and even the German Navy. The Enigma was one of the first electromechanical rotor cipher machines and is considered a milestone in cryptography.\n\nFun Fact: Scherbius died in a riding accident in 1929 and never witnessed the military breakthrough of his invention.\n\nSources: Wikipedia, Bletchley Park, Enigma Museum."
